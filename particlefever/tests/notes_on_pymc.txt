1. This suggested solution of using the previous variable's .value to make discrete Markov chain
will not work:

Because in pymc3, there's no .value for random variables, as this issue says (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31485354/accessing-value-of-a-random-variable-in-pymc3).  Why not?

2. What happened to all the density functions, e.g. binomial_like, in PyMC3?

3. What happend to Lambda from PyMC2?
